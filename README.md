Trzmiel_IT is a python project made for Project Management Tools course at AGH UST.
## Goal
Main goal for making this project was to get used to managment tools such as Scrum, Kanban board or Git.

## Genesis and details
Instead of making easy tic-tac-toe game we decided to create fun, bumblebee-themed game based on Flappy Bird.
Game is based on Object Oriented Programming and Python game development library - PyGame.
Our team worked on this project daily, during two two-week-long sprints.

## Game

The goal is to get past through random generated obstacles. If you touch an obstacle you lose. 
The longer you survive, the higher is your score. Highest score is saved through multiple sessions.
You can jump by pressing spacebar or upward arrow. 
## Results
Our project resulted in finishing course with highest possible grade - 5.0.
Game got pretty popular in our enviroment because of it's difficulty. Many people are still trying to beat their highscore.
